# Car-Black-Box-
This project implements a car black box system using a PIC16F877A microcontroller. It logs vehicle events (ignition, gear changes, collisions) along with time and speed to an external EEPROM. The system also features a password-protected menu for viewing, clearing, and downloading logs, as well as setting the time and changing the password.
